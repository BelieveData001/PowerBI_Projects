# Maintenance Schedule Dynamic Dashboard - README

## Overview
The Maintenance Schedule Dynamic Dashboard provides an interactive visualization of maintenance activities based on key filters. This dashboard is designed to help users analyze maintenance schedules efficiently through various visual representations. Power Query has been used for the ETL process, including data transformation such as adding new columns, deleting empty columns, and removing duplicate records.

## Filters
The dashboard allows users to refine data using the following filters:
- **Team**: Filter maintenance activities by assigned teams.
- **Completion Status**: View completed and pending tasks.
- **Outage/Non-Outage**: Distinguish between outage-related and non-outage maintenance events.
- **Equipment No**: Search for maintenance activities associated with specific equipment.
- **Substation Name**: Filter maintenance tasks based on the substation.
- **Date**: Select a specific date range to view maintenance activities within the chosen timeframe.

## Dashboard Features
The dashboard includes multiple visual representations for better insights:

### 1. Table
- Displays detailed maintenance records.
- Includes columns for team, status, outage type, equipment number, substation, and date.
- Data has been refined by adding new columns, deleting empty columns, and removing duplicate records.

### 2. Pie Chart
- Shows the distribution of maintenance activities based on a selected category.
- Provides a clear percentage-based visual breakdown.

### 3. Donut Chart
- Similar to the pie chart but with a hollow center for an enhanced visual appeal.
- Helps in segmenting maintenance activities efficiently.

### 4. Line Chart
- Displays trends over time.
- Useful for tracking maintenance activities within a selected date range.

### 5. Column Bar Chart
- Compares maintenance tasks across different categories.
- Helps analyze the distribution of maintenance work.

## Usage
1. Apply relevant filters to refine the dataset.
2. View and analyze the data through tables and charts.
3. Use the different chart types to gain insights into maintenance activities and trends.
4. Make data-driven decisions based on the visualized reports.

## Conclusion
This dashboard is an essential tool for maintenance teams to track, manage, and analyze scheduled activities efficiently. It enhances decision-making through interactive data visualizations and filtering options, with data processing handled via Power Query to ensure data integrity and accuracy.
